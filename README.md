# Market-Regime-Clustering-
Identifying market regimes in daily stock returns using PCA and K-means clustering, with interpretable visualizations of regime dynamics over time.
# Overview 

This mini project applies unsupervised learning techniques to identify market regimes in daily stock return data.
Using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and K-means clustering on the reduced features, we group dates with similar return patterns and analyze how market behavior evolves over time.

The project emphasizes interpretability, combining clustering results with multiple visualizations to understand regime dynamics.
